# VEP-based BCI using OpenViBE and ROS
## Introduction
This repository was initially produced in the process of an MSc thesis in the University of Tartu. The main purpose of this repository is to give an overview of the developed OpenViBE and ROS packages for setting up the brain-computer interface (BCI) for robot control.

## Setup
The whole system was set up on Ubuntu 16.04 because of ROS, but the BCI part on OpenViBE can be tested on any other OS. 
### OpenViBE setup
* Linux - download the OpenViBE [source code](http://openvibe.inria.fr/downloads/) and see [build instructions](http://openvibe.inria.fr/build-instructions/) for details.
* Windows - download [Windows installer](http://openvibe.inria.fr/downloads/).
